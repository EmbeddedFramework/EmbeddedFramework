    * not have volatile type and have been changed between the setjmp and

    * As it bypasses the usual function call and return mechanism, the longjmp
    * function shall execute correctly in contexts of interrupts, signals and
    * any of their associated functions. However, if the longjmp function is
    * invoked from a nested signal handler (that is, from a function invoked
    * as a result of a signal raised during the handling of another signal),
    * the behaviour is undefined.
    * Returns: After longjmp is completed, program execution continues as if
    *          the corresponding call to setjmp had just returned the value
    *          specified by val. The longjmp function cannot cause setjmp to
    *          return the value 0; if val is 0, setjmp returns the value 1.
